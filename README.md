# README

This project was written by Justin Kim in October of 2022 as part of theOdinProject curriculum. (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project) 

Technology used:
  Ruby on Rails
  Stimulus
  Turboframes
  Bulma
  Devise
  S3 Amazon Web Services
  OmniAuth(Facebook)

Goal:
  Create a fully functioning(if basic) social media site with comments, posts, likes, and friendships.  The main things I hoped to learn going into this project are as follows:
    - Using new rails 7 features such as stimulus, turbolink, and turbostream.
    - Creating a CRUD site with several tables and models all interlinked and planning out a scalable and reliable data framework.
    - Learning to write both model and integration tests.
    - Learn how to debug across environments(testing, development, production)

Time spent:
  I began this project on 9/24/22 and finished on 10/24/22, averaging 2.38 hours a day over the month.

Reflections:
  This project was one of my favorites of the curriculum so far, I really enjoyed the freedom offered in what features to add or not.  I feel that there was many more things I could and wanted to add such as a sidebar and using turbostream/frames to emulate a single page application but for the sake of time and future projects I decided I would stop where I did.  

  My regret with this project is that I decided to use Bulma as a framework from the start instead of trying something new like Tailwind or even Bootstrap.  I could have used this as a learning opportunity to get familiar with another frontend framework but I decided to use the same one.  In my next app I think I'll try Tailwind to try a framework with a little more freedom to edit things and make the page exactly how I'd like it.  

To-do
- add sidebar maybe
- Maybe add profile pictures to the people
- restyle login page
