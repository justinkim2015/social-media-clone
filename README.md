To-do

-Add more authencation so i cant edit other ppls pages
-use turbo frames for like and dislike
-add some javascript and fix styling
- continue editing the add friends page

Currently I think the way I can solve my updating likes with turboframes issue is that I need to put the # of likes into a turbo frame pointing to somewhere with the correct number of likes.  I think I don't mind just googling how do I make like unlike with turboframes
